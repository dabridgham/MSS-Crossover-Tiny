= MSS Crossover

A KiCad project for a circuit board that implements an
https://www.modularsignalsystem.info/index.html[MSS] Crossover node.
It includes the block detection circuit and the crossover wiring
between two RJ45 connectors.

This circuit is implemented with a resistor as the current sense
element and then an ATtiny to do the math.
