= MSS Crossover

A KiCad project for a circuit board that implements an
https://www.modularsignalsystem.info/index.html[MSS] Detection node
(aka Crossover node).  It includes the block detection circuit and the
crossover wiring between two RJ45 connectors.

The block detection is implemented with a resistor as the current
sense element and then an ATtiny to do the math.  The board includes
the bridge rectifier so it can be powered off the ACC bus and it uses
optoisolators to drive the MSS line.
